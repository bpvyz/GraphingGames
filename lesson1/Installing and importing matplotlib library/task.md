## Step 6: Install and Import Matplotlib for Visualization

In this step, youâ€™ll install the `matplotlib` library, which is essential for creating visualizations in Python. Then, you'll import it to prepare for plotting data in future steps.

### Instructions

1. **Install Matplotlib**  
   To get started with `matplotlib`, install it using pip.

2. **Import Matplotlib**  
   Once `matplotlib` is installed, import the `matplotlib.pyplot` module as `plt` into your code to make the plotting functions available for your project.

3. **Verify Installation**  
   After installation and import, test `matplotlib` by running a simple plot command, such as a bar plot or line plot with sample data.
